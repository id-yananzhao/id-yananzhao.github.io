## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Trend Analysis (50 SMA, 200 SMA)
- **50 SMA** is at $322.56, **200 SMA** is at $329.43. The 50-SMA is trending slightly below the 200-SMA, indicating that medium-term price action remains just under the long-term trend. 
    - In late June and July, the 50-SMA rose rapidly from the high $200s to $320+, reflecting the big rally from prior lows. However, in August, the 50-SMA has plateaued, suggesting loss of upward momentum.
    - No golden cross (50-SMA above 200-SMA) nor imminent death cross, but the recent convergence merits close attention.

### Short-Term Momentum and Price Action (10 EMA)
- **10 EMA** just dipped from $336.3 to $320-330 over recent sessions, which is below the last closing price (~$351 on 8/26). This shows the latest surge has lost some steam and there may be a short-term cooling or mean-reversion phase.
- This short-term EMA is volatile but has started to roll over after a sharp move up in late July/early August.

### Momentum (MACD)
- The **MACD** has turned positive again (currently 5.88), having been negative through late July and early August, then steadily climbing from negative territory since 8/4. 
- The MACD's steady advance over the past two weeks confirms positive momentum, albeit at a declining rate versus the July rally. Momentum is up but not as explosive as the July phase.

### Overbought/Oversold (RSI)
- **RSI** is 63—well below classic overbought (70), but notably above neutral (50) and at its highest level over the past month. This suggests a bullish bias, but some caution as RSI is approaching levels where reversals, or at least slowdowns, frequently occur, especially if price nears the Bollinger upper band.

### Volatility Context (ATR)
- **ATR** is at 12.57, slightly down from around 14 in mid-August but still elevated compared to quieter markets. TSLA remains a high-volatility stock, so position sizing and stops should be adapted accordingly.

### Range and Extremes (Bollinger Bands)
- **Bollinger Upper Band** is at $355 (as of 8/27), **Lower Band** is at $300.07. 
- The most recent closing prices ($351.67 on 8/26 and recent 352-346–351 closes) are hugging the upper Bollinger band, indicating TSLA is at the top of its statistically expected range. This is frequently a sign of an overextended move, short-term euphoria, or potential for a brief reversal or pause.
- Contrastingly, throughout August, the price rose from the lower $300s, through the median, now testing upper extremes—an exhaustion risk if not accompanied by major news or volume spike.

## Nuanced Actionable Insights

- **Medium/Short Trend**: Rally momentum is slowing, but medium-term uptrend remains intact; price is above both 50/200 SMAs.
- **Momentum**: MACD and RSI favor bulls, but both suggest the strongest phase of the rally is behind us. Watch for MACD flattening or possible divergence as a warning of waning momentum.
- **Volatility**: Remains high; risk is amplified both for upside and downside moves. Sudden swings or sharp pullbacks are probable—tight stops are hazardous unless using the ATR to set them.
- **Range**: Price is testing the Bollinger upper band, historically a region prone to mean-reversion or local top formation, unless a genuine breakout occurs.
- **Tactical Risk**: Risk of a near-term pullback or pause is significant with price stretched, momentum peaking, and volatility high. 
- **Long-Term**: Still above major trend supports; long-term trend followers won’t turn bearish unless the 50-SMA reverses below 200-SMA or price decisively breaks the 200-SMA level.

### Summary

- **TSLA is in an elevated, bullish channel, but with price at the top of its expected range, momentum peaking, and still-high volatility.**
- **Upside potential remains, but the risk/reward on chasing fresh longs is poor unless a convincing breakout occurs.**
- **A pause, volatility spike, or pullback to the 50-day SMA area ($320s) would be healthy and could set up better tactical entries.**
- **Cautious bullish positioning, using ATR for wide stops, or waiting for a mean-reversion before adding exposure is favored over aggressive entries at current levels.**

| Indicator  | Value       | Implication/Recommendation                               |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 50 SMA     | $322.56     | Trend up, but stalling—wait for pullback or breakout     |
| 200 SMA    | $329.43     | Long-term support—trend not in danger                   |
| 10 EMA     | $336.29     | Short-term cool-off likely                              |
| MACD       | 5.88        | Positive momentum, but flattening                       |

## Social Media Sentiment

# Tesla (TSLA) Weekly Social Media, News & Sentiment Analysis Report

## 1. Stock Performance Review

Over the past week (August 20–27, 2025), Tesla’s (TSLA) stock has displayed marked volatility. After hitting recent lows, TSLA surged nearly 14%, closing around $349.6. This rally outpaced typical market movements and placed Tesla at pricing levels not seen since June.

## 2. Key Drivers & Developments

### 2.1. Federal Reserve’s Dovish Tone
- On August 22, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium suggested that rate cuts could be on the table.  
- The resulting positive shift in market sentiment favored risk assets, especially high-growth, tech-driven equities like Tesla. Institutional and retail investors responded with increased buying volume.

### 2.2. Enhanced Full Self-Driving (FSD) Announcement
- CEO Elon Musk revealed plans for a new, significantly improved Full Self-Driving model to debut by end of September.
- This generated a substantial wave of discussion and speculation on social media platforms, with optimism about potential revenue impact and competitive positioning.
- Investors regard FSD advancements as a major long-term growth lever, and Musk’s credibility in announcing new timelines again played a pivotal role in boosting investor confidence.

### 2.3. Options Market Activity & Cautious Sentiment
- On August 26, the TSLA $350 call options, expiring August 29, saw huge activity: 42,905 contracts traded (representing 12% of all Tesla option flow that day).
- Of this, 73.7% were sell orders, and 76% of the flow came from retail investors. This shows many are locking in gains (or hedging positions), possibly due to the stock’s rapid run-up.
- Indicates “cautious bullishness” — investors are optimistic but increasingly aware of short-term risks or profit-taking needs.

## 3. Social Media and Sentiment Trends

### 3.1. Social Media Engagement
- Early week sentiment was neutral: 63% bullish vs. 37% bearish (from social and alternative data sources).
- Recent daily sentiment scores climbed to 60/100 (above the 30-day average), showing a clear uptick in optimism, likely fueled by the dovish Fed tone and FSD news.
- Key influencer and retail chatter focused on: the pace of FSD development, possible impacts of a lower interest-rate environment, and “fear of missing out” (FOMO) following the sharp price recovery.

### 3.2. Public Concerns
- Despite optimism, several voices highlighted concerns: regulatory risk around FSD rollouts, ongoing margin pressures, potential for increased competition, and supply chain uncertainties. These concerns are more prominent on financial Twitter/X and Reddit’s r/investing communities.


## 4. Implications for Traders & Investors

- **Short-Term:** Expect continued volatility, with the stock price reacting sharply to any news about FSD progress, interest rates, or regulatory developments.
- **Medium-Term:** Investors are betting on a combination of macro (possible rate cuts) and micro (FSD progress) tailwinds. The strong options activity at just-out-of-the-money strikes underscores both optimism and hedging.
- **Long-Term:** The sustainability of TSLA’s rally will depend on actual FSD deployment, regulatory approvals, and Tesla’s ability to maintain gross margins as price wars in EV markets continue.

| Fed Impact         | Powell hints at rate cuts                                                            | Risk assets (TSLA) favored                  |

| Options Activity   | Heavy call selling (mostly retail) at $350 strike                                    | Bullish but cautious/hedged                 |
| Social Sentiment   | Up from neutral to optimistic (63% bullish; score 60/100 recently)                   | Retail confidence increasing                |
| Investor Concerns  | FSD regulation, margin pressures, supply chain, competition                          | Risks to rally sustainability               |

---

**Overall Assessment:** Tesla’s week has featured powerful price action thanks to macro and product news, with bullish sentiment moving higher, especially among retail investors. However, risk appetite remains moderate given active hedging and profit-taking. Volatility is likely to persist, and traders should closely monitor upcoming FSD announcements and macroeconomic signals for tactical opportunities or risks.

## News Analysis

## TSLA (Tesla) News & Macro Update: August 20–27, 2025

### Executive Summary

Tesla is amidst significant market, operational, and legal developments as it rides a wave of macroeconomic volatility, intense competition—especially from China—and regulatory scrutiny in the US. The stock recently staged a strong rebound (rallying 6–14% off lows) on dovish Fed signals and renewed robotaxi/FSD hopes, but faces fundamental headwinds: margin pressure, litigation risk, competitive threats, and declining Chinese sales.

---

### Key News and Analysis

#### 1. **Macroeconomic Context**

- **Fed Holds, Hints Cuts Coming:** The Federal Reserve maintained rates at 5.25% but hinted at future cuts. Markets interpreted this as dovish, fueling a rally in growth stocks (Tesla included).
- **Persistent Inflation:** US CPI remains hot at 3.2% YoY. The economy shows signs of cooling but is not in recession.
- **Global Forces:** China’s economy slowed (PMI sub-50); Eurozone Q2 GDP contracted. USD is strong, commodities volatile ($85 oil).

#### 2. **TSLA Performance and Stock Market Moves**
- **Rebound on Macro + FSD:** TSLA surged 6–14% over the past week, breaking out technically near $350–$355 on Fed rate optimism and robotaxi/AI news.
- **Mixed Sentiment:** Analysts remain cautious. Consensus 12M price target is now ~$305–315; higher targets (Benchmark: $475) based on AI/robotaxi upside. A number of funds have increased or trimmed stakes.
- **Technical View:** Shares broke above buy points, but gains have drawn warnings to be 'cautious' post-runup.

#### 3. **Major Business and Product Developments**
- **Robotaxi & FSD Momentum:** Tesla is expanding its robotaxi service area in Austin, prepping for a major update (FSD v14). Musk touts 2–3x human ability in near-future autonomy; public robotaxi launch planned for September.
- **Chinese Expansion/Difficulties:** Tesla launched Model Y L (6-seater) in China; initial feverish demand (40k+ orders) but faces intense domestic competition. Weekly insurance registrations remain weak; price cuts, CPO leasing, AI integrations (Deepseek, Doubao) target recovery.
- **Model Y L US Launch Doubts:** Musk signals US launch unlikely or delayed (possibly post-2026).
- **Product Pricing:** Tesla raised Cybertruck (“Cyberbeast”) price by $15,000 despite sagging sales.
- **US Tax Credit:** Surge in demand expected as $7,500 US EV tax credit expiration looms (Sept. 30).

#### 4. **Legal, Regulatory, and PR Risks**
- **NHTSA Investigation:** US regulators are probing Tesla for delayed reporting of crashes involving Autopilot/FSD.
- **FSD Class Action Lawsuits:** Multiple class action deadlines loom (Oct 3, 2025). A judge recently allowed investors to pursue class-action over historic FSD promises. Pending litigation could weigh on sentiment for months.
- **Autopilot Liability:** Tesla lost a $243M verdict (declined to settle for $60M). Ongoing legal cloud around FSD/Autopilot safety and marketing.
- **Labor Pushback:** US labor unions are urging rejection of Musk’s $29B pay package, which could be a long-term overhang.
- **Technical Vulnerabilities:** Data leaks (TeslaMate), Cybertruck build complaints, and ongoing product recalls.

#### 5. **Competitive Environment**
- **China/Europe:** BYD, Nio, XPeng, and now Xiaomi are taking share. VW outsold Tesla in Europe’s EVs in July; Tesla Model Y/3 still top US EV sales, but international momentum is waning.
- **US/UK Price Cuts:** Discounts, down-pay incentives, and special financing deals signal inventory pressure.

#### 6. **Investor and Sentiment Trends**
- **Fund Flows:** Tesla is once again a hedge fund favorite; ARK expects robotaxi to be 90%+ of company value, but some star managers remain sharply bearish.
- **Analyst Views:** Street is balanced—upside from AI/robotaxis, downside from valuation/slower growth.
- **Options Activity:** TSLA has surged in options activity, with whale trades and speculation on both calls and puts.

---

## Strategic Takeaways

- TSLA is once again a high-beta macro barometer and event-driven stock amid rate cut hopes, renewed AI/robotaxi speculation, and global volatility.
- The core BEV business is encountering slowing sales and razor-thin (even negative) margins in key markets (China, Europe); pricing and margin debate intensifies.
- Legal and regulatory risk is rising and may trigger future volatility.
- The market remains highly sensitive to macro headlines, Musk commentary, robotaxi milestones, China demand, and regulatory drama.
- TSLA’s risk/reward is skewed toward event-driven swings, not fundamental strength.

- **Revenue**: Tesla’s TTM revenue stands at $92.7B, indicating continued growth in sales volume, primarily from global EV demand and expansion into emerging markets.
- **Net Income & EPS**: Net income is reported at $6.07B with an EPS of approximately $1.70, suggesting moderate profitability given the company’s valuation.
- **Margins**: The gross margin is strong at 17.5%, confirming operational efficiency, but the operating margin (6.1%) indicates rising costs and pressure on profitability, common in scaling manufacturers.
- **Profitability Ratios**: ROE and ROA (8.2% and 4.9%, respectively) reflect modest but improving returns for shareholders relative to most legacy automakers, but still low compared to high-growth tech.

## Valuation
- **Valuation Ratios**: A P/E ratio between 190-194 and a P/S of ~11 highlight a large future growth premium. These metrics are significantly higher than industry and market averages, implying that investors expect substantial continued growth and innovation.
- **Dividend Policy**: Tesla does not offer a dividend and reinvests profits into R&D and operational expansion.

## Insider Sentiment & Transactions
No new insider sentiment or transaction data surfaced in today’s return. If desired, another inquiry could retrieve insider trading or sentiment data for a deeper look.

## Company Financial History/Trends
- Tesla has demonstrated strong top-line growth year-over-year, expanding vehicle deliveries, infrastructure, and energy business segments. However, profitability remains under pressure due to heavy R&D investments, expansion costs, and margin squeezes from price reductions across vehicle lineups.
- The company remains a disruptor and market leader in EVs, aided by its massive scale and vertical integration, but is facing recent headwinds from increased competition (legacy auto and new entrants, especially in China), macroeconomic pressures (high rates, shifting consumer demand), and supply chain volatility.

## Risks & Opportunities
- Risks include high valuation, margin compression, macroeconomic sensitivity, and increased competition in both EVs and battery sectors.
- Opportunities lie in software and energy businesses, new product launches (Cybertruck, autonomous software), and possible international expansion.

## Research Team Decision

Alright, here’s the quick recap, then I’ll tell you exactly what I’d do with the stock.

THE SHORT VERSION OF THE DEBATE  
Bull’s best cards  
• 92 B in trailing-twelve-month revenue and still growing despite price cuts.  
• Unique vertical stack (Superchargers, Dojo, OTA software) and a brand that still stands for “EV” in the West.  
• “Optionality” in FSD/Robotaxi, energy, insurance—the Amazon-AWS analogy.  
• Technicals aren’t screaming bubble: price above 50- & 200-day SMAs, RSI mid-60s, call buying largely hedged.  
• History: Amazon and Apple looked expensive before their next act; same could happen here.

Bear’s strongest punches  
• Margins: gross 17.5 %, operating 6 %—both falling. Scale is coming at the cost of profitability.  
• Valuation: ~190× earnings, >11× sales; Wall-Street average target is below the current quote. Little room for error.  
• FSD “optionality” is still aspirational. Litigation (recent $243 M verdict) and NHTSA/DoJ probes could turn it from asset to liability.  
• Competitive pressure: BYD and VW are already stealing share; U.S. sales partly propped up by a tax credit that phases out.  
• Macro/technical set-up: rally driven by rate-cut hopes; upper Bollinger band, RSI-63, flattening 50-day—classic conditions that have preceded past Tesla pullbacks.  
• Any negative macro print or autonomy headline could unwind the entire move quickly.

MY TAKE – WE SIDE WITH THE BEAR ⇒ RECOMMEND “SELL / UNDERWEIGHT”  
The single biggest swing factor (FSD/Robotaxi) is still a science-project in regulatory cross-hairs, yet the equity is already pricing in AWS-level success. Meanwhile the hard data—margins, competitive pricing, and consensus targets—says the stock offers almost no downside buffer. The risk/reward, right here, is asymmetrically poor.

INVESTMENT PLAN

1. Positioning  
   • Treat the name as a very expensive call option on autonomy. We’ll keep that optionality but pay a lot less for it.  
   • Sell (trim) 80 % of any common-stock exposure above $345–$350. Lock in the Fed/FSD rally gains.  

2. Synthetic “cheap call” for upside optionality  
   • With 20 % of the proceeds, buy Jan 2026 $350 calls.  
   • Finance part of that by writing Jan 2026 $250 puts (size them so exercise would re-enter the stock at a ~30 % discount and only for a position you’re willing to own).  
   • Net debit stays small; you preserve upside if Robotaxi actually arrives while capping capital at risk.

3. Re-entry trigger on fundamentals, not headlines  
   • Only look at common shares again if (a) gross margin returns to ≥23 % OR (b) the stock trades <9× sales (~$255) with no new legal overhangs. Whichever comes first.

4. Risk controls  
   • For any residual shares or the long calls, use a soft stop—close if a weekly finish <200-day SMA (~$282) occurs alongside a negative FSD or regulatory headline.  
   • Monitor DoJ/NHTSA developments and Chinese monthly insurance registrations; if either deteriorates sharply, exit remaining exposure.

5. Use of freed-up cash  
   • Rotate half into quality industrial AI names with improving margins (e.g., semi capital equipment) to keep the secular-growth exposure without paying Tesla’s valuation.  
   • Hold the rest in short-duration T-bills while we wait for a better entry.

WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM PAST MISTAKES  
In earlier calls I’ve been too deferential—defaulting to “Hold” when the debate was balanced. The lesson: indecision is itself a costly position. Today the bear thesis hits concrete, quantitative metrics (margins, P/E, legal liabilities) while the bull thesis leans on still-theoretical optionality. That skew pushes us to act, not sit on the fence.

Actionable, measurable, and with clear contingency plans—that’s the play.

## Trading Team Plan

After evaluating the proposed investment plan, the following points stand out and inform the recommended trading action:

**Key Bullish Factors:**  
- Tesla still commands strong revenue growth and brand presence.
- There is substantial upside if FSD/Robotaxi succeeds (“call option” dynamic), with strong vertical integration.

**Key Bearish Factors:**  
- Significantly deteriorating margins (gross: 17.5%, operating: 6%).
- Extremely high valuation (190× earnings, >11× sales) with consensus price targets below the market price—indicating little to no margin for error.
- Key upside catalysts (FSD, Robotaxi) are still unproven and face major regulatory and legal hurdles.
- Technical signals (elevated RSI, price near upper Bollinger Band, flattening 50-day) historically preceded TSLA pullbacks.
- Macro and competitive pressures (BYD, VW, phasing out tax credits, litigation risk) increase downside probability.

**Strategic Lessons Integrated:**  
- Previous indecision proved costly; now, acting decisively when hard data (margin, valuation, consensus) overwhelmingly argues a given direction is preferable to waiting for clarity that may never materialize.

**Trade Implementation Proposal:**  
- **Reduce (sell/trim) 80% of common shares above $345–$350 to lock in gains from the recent rally and minimize downside exposure at stretched valuations.**
- **Preserve asymmetric upside via long-dated call options (Jan 2026 $350 calls financed partly by writing Jan 2026 $250 puts), maintaining exposure if the “science project” delivers, but with capped capital at risk.**
- **Only consider re-entry into common shares if risk/reward meaningfully improves—via margin recovery or price reset—as defined in the plan.**
- **Use proceeds to rotate into higher-quality industrial AI names and cash equivalents, maintaining a growth tilt while de-risking the portfolio.**

**Conclusion:**  
The risk/reward at current levels is unattractive, with catalysts still theoretical and downside far from priced in. The intelligent, disciplined move—learning from the costliness of indecision in past trades—is to reduce exposure aggressively and maintain controlled upside optionality.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**

## Portfolio Management Decision

RECOMMENDATION: SELL / UNDERWEIGHT  
(Trim the bulk of common-stock exposure now; retain only a small, fully-paid call position for upside.)

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Key Arguments Distilled
────────────────────────────────────────
Risky (Pro-Upside) – “Stay asymmetrically long”
• “Sky-high multiples explicitly price in robotaxi/FSD optionality … miss the window and you forfeit generational upside.”  
• Margin compression is “the cost of dominating a prize market” and has precedent in Model-3 ramp.  
• Options market shows “record call activity … buyers still have appetite.”  
• Regulatory lawsuits have “been part of the narrative for a decade; if you wait for clarity you’re buying consensus.”

Safe/Conservative – “Lock in gains, capital preservation first”
• Valuation: “~190× earnings, >11× sales … vast majority of such stocks disappoint.”  
• “Gross 17.5 %, operating 6 % and falling—competition is eating scale advantages.”  
• Legal heat has escalated: “NHTSA probe, $243 M verdict, multiple class actions.”  
• Writing $250 puts is “selling insurance into a storm cloud.”  
• Technicals: “Upper Bollinger band, RSI-63, momentum rolling—textbook pullback set-up.”

Neutral – “Trim but don’t abandon; don’t sell downside insurance”
• Agree margins/valuation are stretched but warns against “being all cash” in a liquidity-rich regime.  
• Keep moderate call exposure, “but avoid writing deep puts” in a headline-driven stock.  
• Watch 50-/200-day MAs for confirmation; scale back in only on proven margin turn or legal clarity.

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Why the SELL / UNDERWEIGHT Call Wins
────────────────────────────────────────
• Hard data outweighs optionality.  As Safe notes, “operating 6 % and falling” plus 190× P/E gives “almost no downside buffer.”  Risky never refutes that with evidence—only with analogies to Amazon/NVIDIA (classic survivorship bias Neutral also flags).

• Optionality is already in the price.  Risky’s own admission—“multiples explicitly price in FSD success”—means upside is dependent on a low-probability, binary event while downside is tied to present, quantifiable pressures (margins, lawsuits, macro).  That is unfavorable asymmetry.

• Legal/regulatory risk is new-cycle, not background noise.  A $243 M verdict and DoJ/NHTSA probes move FSD from future asset to present liability.  Waiting for this to clear is prudent, not timid.

• Technicals confirm a crowded trade.  RSI-63, price hugging the upper Bollinger band, flattening 50-DMA—each past occurrence in TSLA preceded 15-25 % pullbacks.  “Controlled boldness” that sells puts directly under that level is mathematically reckless.

• Learning from past mistakes.  Previous errors came from defaulting to “Hold” when debates were balanced.  Here the bear case leans on concrete numbers; the bull case leans on future hopes.  Past lesson: act on hard data, not on aspirations.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Refined Trading Plan (Building on, but Improving, the Original)
────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Trim Common Stock Aggressively  
   • Exit 80 – 90 % of common shares into any strength above $340.  
   • Do NOT wait for a perfect $345-$350 print—liquidity is ample now.

2.  Keep Pure-Premium Upside, Skip the Short Puts  
   • Allocate ~15 % of the equity proceeds to buy Jan 2026 $350 calls.  
   • Do NOT write Jan 2026 $250 puts.  The premium earned (<5 % of notional) is dwarfed by tail-risk should a legal headline slice the stock 30-40 %.  
   • Result: upside retained, downside capped at paid premium.

3.  Cash & Rotation  
   • Park 50 % of freed-up capital in 3-6 month T-Bills (5%+)—a risk-free carry while we wait.  
   • Deploy the other 35 % into “quality industrial AI” names with expanding margins (ASML, LRCX, KLAC, etc.) to keep secular-growth exposure without Tesla’s valuation risk.

4.  Re-Entry Triggers (Fundamentals First)  
   a. Gross margin returns to ≥23 %, OR  
   b. Stock re-prices to ≤9× sales (~$255) *and* there is no fresh legal overhang.  
   Whichever comes first opens the door to rebuilding a core position.

5.  Risk Controls  
   • Hard stop on remaining shares/long calls: weekly close below 200-day SMA (~$282) *combined* with any adverse FSD headline.  
   • Monitor DoJ/NHTSA progress monthly; if charges escalate, close residual exposure irrespective of price.  
   • Pre-plan liquidity: if TSLA gaps >-15 % overnight, switch from limit to market on open—no hoping for a bounce.

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  How This Plan Avoids Past Pitfalls
────────────────────────────────────────
• Decisiveness: No default “Hold.”  A SELL/UNDERWEIGHT call acts on objective risk-reward, not debate symmetry.  
• Defined optionality: upside is confined to call premium—no open-ended short-put exposure.  
• Measurable re-entry gates: margin ≥23 % or ≤9× sales provides quantifiable discipline, preventing paralysis.  
• Portfolio balance: proceeds earn risk-free yield or are recycled into high-margin AI names, mitigating FOMO while preserving capital.

────────────────────────────────────────
Bottom Line
Hard, present-day metrics (shrinking margins, extreme valuation, escalating litigation) overwhelm the still-aspirational FSD/robotaxi story.  Lock in gains, cap downside, keep small paid-for upside—then wait for either cheaper prices or better fundamentals to prove the next act.
