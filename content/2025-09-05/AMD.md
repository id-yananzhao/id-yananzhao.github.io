- September 4, 2025: $161.79

The stock showed a subtle decline from its opening price of $158.42 on September 2, contrasting with a gradual upward trend before this period, reaching a high of $164.75 on September 3.

#### Key Indicators Overview

1. **10 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: 
   - Current Value: **164.94**
   - The 10 EMA reflects a responsive short-term average that tracks recent price movements closely. It signifies that short-term momentum is still leaning upwards, which could present potential entry points for day traders.

2. **50 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: 
   - Current Value: **160.94**
   - This indicator identifies medium-term trends and shows that AMD has remained above this average for the last few trading sessions, suggesting that the medium-term outlook remains positive as long as prices don’t close below this level.

3. **200 SMA**: 
   - Current Value: **125.62**

   - The RSI indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral zone. This suggests potential for movement in either direction; however, traders should monitor closely for changes.

8. **ATR (Average True Range)**: 
   - Latest Value: **6.24**
   - The ATR measures current volatility. With the current ATR trend, traders are advised to adjust their stop-loss levels to mitigate risk, especially given the mixed signals from momentum indicators.

### Summary and Outlook
The current analysis shows that AMD's market indicators are yielding mixed signals: 
- The **10 EMA** and **50 SMA** suggest a bullish outlook in the short and medium term, keeping traders interested.
- However, the **MACD** and related metrics warn of potential weakening momentum, advising caution.
- The **RSI** remains neutral, showing no extreme buying or selling pressure.

AMD should be closely monitored for price levels around the **50 SMA** for potential trading signals. A close below this average could open up the downside, while maintaining above could lend strength to an upward movement.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**

## Research Team Decision

All right, here’s how I see the debate distilled to its essentials and what I would actually do with the stock today.

1. The bull’s best points  
• Industry tail-winds: AI, data-center and custom silicon are all growing faster than the broader semiconductor market.  
• Product pipeline: EPYC CPU share gains and the still-early ramp of the MI300 accelerator family give AMD a shot at taking some datacenter GPU share for the first time in years.  
• Financial health: ~50 % gross margin, $7 B cash vs. $3.8 B debt gives AMD room to invest.  
• Optionality: collaborations (IBM/quantum, chiplet IP deals) create longer-term upside that is not yet in numbers.

2. The bear’s best points  
• Competitive dominance: Nvidia controls ~94 % of discrete GPUs; AMD’s PC GPU share is 6 % and essentially zero in datacenter GPUs today. Winning real share requires dislodging an entrenched leader with superior software moat (CUDA).  
• Valuation vs. execution risk: $224 B market cap on $27 B sales and sub-$2 EPS = 60-70× earnings, leaving little margin for error.  
• Recent red flags: $800 M inventory write-off tied to export restrictions; Seaport downgrade; momentum indicators (MACD, RSI) rolling over, suggesting waning near-term demand for the shares.  
• Macro overlay: Rate cuts may arrive because growth is slowing—a backdrop that often compresses lofty multiples.

Decision – Sell / Under-weight (align with the bear)

Why I’m siding with the bear  
The debate hinges on whether AMD can rapidly monetize MI300 and future GPUs strongly enough to justify a 60-plus forward P/E. The bullish story is possible, but the bear lays out hard evidence that the share price already discounts a great deal of that success while competitive, execution and regulatory risks are mounting. When expectations are this high and the moat (software, ecosystem) is still Nvidia’s, the risk-reward skews to the downside in the next 6-12 months.

Investment plan

1. Positioning  
• If you hold AMD at a gain: trim 50-75 % of the position immediately around current levels to lock in profit.  
• If you are flat: do not initiate a long here; look elsewhere or keep dry powder.

2. Price objectives  
• Downside re-entry zone: $105–$110 (roughly 25 % below today and ~12× 2026 EBITDA assumptions).  
• Risk guardrail: If shares unexpectedly break above the recent high near $225 on convincingly higher volume and datacenter GPU share data, be ready to revisit the thesis.

3. Hedging / alternatives  
• Pair trade: Long a broad semi ETF (SOXX) against a short/under-weight AMD. You stay exposed to the secular semiconductor up-cycle while fading AMD-specific execution risk.  
• Covered calls: For remaining shares, sell 3- to 6-month OTM calls (~10 % above spot) to harvest premium while you wait for catalysts.

4. Catalysts to monitor  
• Actual MI300 shipment and revenue run-rate disclosed in the next two quarters.  
• Competitive product launches (Nvidia Blackwell) and CUDA ecosystem momentum.  
• Export-control developments—further restrictions could trigger another inventory charge.  
• Any deterioration in gross margin below 48 % would confirm pricing pressure.

5. Review cadence  
• Re-evaluate after Q2 earnings call. Update the thesis if MI300 backlog and software adoption exceed expectations or if valuation materially de-rates.

Lessons applied from past mistakes  
Previously I have defaulted to “Hold” when faced with a high-potential tech story versus valuation risk, only to see outsized draw-downs when execution slipped (e.g., INTC 2021, NVDA 2018). This time I’m forcing a stance: the downside from over-expectation is greater than the upside from perfect execution that is already partly priced in. By trimming or avoiding the name now, we keep optionality to repurchase on proof or at a more reasonable multiple.

Bottom line  
Great company, great roadmap—wrong price for the risk today. Lighten up, stay objective, and be ready to re-enter when adoption and valuation converge.

## Trading Team Plan

Based on the comprehensive analysis of AMD's current situation, various factors have led me to a conclusion. The strengths, including the growth potential in AI and custom silicon, as well as the financial health of AMD, are compelling arguments in favor of the company. However, significant risks cast a shadow over these positives.

The competitive landscape against giants like Nvidia, coupled with AMD's existing low market share in crucial areas such as datacenter GPUs and the recent red flags concerning inventory and valuations, present serious concerns. Additionally, with a high P/E ratio already reflecting anticipated success, the scope for downside risk appears pronounced.

In light of these factors:
- The recommendation to trim holdings aligns with protecting gains and mitigating potential losses.
- For those who are not currently invested, entering AMD at this valuation appears unwarranted.

Hence, the action steps which suggest a focus on managing risk by reducing exposure to AMD make sense. The emphasis on waiting for more favorable entry points or for positive catalysts demonstrates prudence in a volatile tech sector.

Considering the analysis and lessons learned from past decisions where holding out for potential upside led to significant losses, it’s clear that the best course of action is to prioritize risk management.

Based on the outlined analysis, my firm decision is to:

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**

RECOMMENDATION  
Sell / Under-weight (reduce exposure now, keep a small “prove-it” stub only if tax or mandate constraints apply).

——————————————————————————  
1. Key Points From Each Analyst  
• Risky (Bull)  
  – “Investors are not just buying current performance but also betting on future growth” in AI, custom silicon and quantum partnerships.  
  – 10-EMA > 50-SMA and pending Fed rate cuts could “create a favorable environment for equities.”  
  – Social-media buzz and ESG initiatives may reinforce brand loyalty.

• Neutral  
  – A P/E of 136 “is a significant indicator of risk… if AMD stumbles—even slightly—the stock could face a sharp decline.”  
  – Recommends “trimming current holdings while maintaining a core position” and watching technicals.

• Safe / Conservative (Bear)  
  – “Nvidia controls 94 % of the GPU market” and still owns the CUDA software moat.  
  – “$800 M inventory write-off” and a 60-70× forward P/E leave “little margin for error.”  
  – MACD/RSI are “rolling over,” and global macro weakness can compress multiples.

2. Why the Sell Stance Still Wins  

Valuation vs. Execution Gap  
• Even the bull concedes the P/E is extreme; the only defense is that “tech deserves it.” History (INTC 2021, NVDA 2018, AMD 2022) shows that when earnings have to sprint just to keep valuation flat, any slip yields 30-40 % draw-downs.  
• MI300 sales are still projections; the Street already models ~$4 B of accelerator revenue for 2025. That upside is partially in the price but the downside (supply, software stack, export bans) is not.

Competitive Reality  
• Risky’s “niche areas” argument skirts the elephant: Nvidia’s 94 % share is accelerating, not decelerating, as H100/H200 shortages convert to Blackwell pre-orders. AMD has yet to prove that ROCm can dislodge CUDA.  

Operational Red Flags  
• The $800 M China-related write-off is not a one-off if additional export restrictions appear.  
• Gross margin has topped out at ~51 %; every MI300 sold at discounted hyperscaler pricing could drag that lower.

Technical & Macro Overlay  
• Short-term EMA/SMA strength is already fading; MACD turned negative last week.  
• Rate cuts that arrive because growth is slowing are historically multiple-compressive for richly priced cyclicals like semis (see 2001, 2008, 2020 Q1).

Counter-Checks on the Bullish Case  
• Community/ESG goodwill is valuable but does not fill earnings gaps.  
• A “Fed tail-wind” is not unique to AMD—you can capture it via cheaper, better-diversified vehicles (SOXX, SMH) or via TSM, which trades at <20× EPS.

3. Refined Action Plan (updates in bold)  

a) Position Sizing  
   • If long with a gain: Immediately sell 60-70 % (was 50-75 %) to crystallize profits.  
   • Retain only a token position (≤0.5 % portfolio weight) if you must stay exposed for mandate or wash-sale reasons; otherwise exit completely.  

b) Tactical Execution  
   • Use a VWAP-based limit order today; stock has averaged $155-$160.  
   • For the rump stake, write 3-month 175-strike covered calls (≈10 % OTM, 7-8 % annualized yield); if called away you exit the remainder at a better price.

c) Re-entry Roadmap  
   • Buyback zone tightened to $105-$115 (roughly 12× 2026e EBITDA, 25-30 % below spot).  
   • Automatic review trigger: Close above $225 on >30 % 20-day average volume AND proof that MI300 annualized revenue run-rate ≥$10 B.

d) Portfolio Hedge  
   • Pair-trade stays: Long SOXX vs. short / under-weight AMD, rebalanced monthly.  
   • Optional: Buy June 2025 $120 puts (~7 % premium) as cheap catastrophe insurance if you cannot reduce the core holding for tax reasons.

e) Catalyst Watchlist  
   • Q2/Q3 datacenter GPU revenue trajectory.  
   • Nvidia Blackwell launch benchmarks and hyperscaler adoption.  
   • Any further U.S./China export-control tightening.  
   • Gross-margin trend—sub-48 % is immediate thesis validation to the downside.

4. Lessons Applied From Past Errors  

Past mistake: Defaulting to “Hold” on richly valued tech (INTC 2021, NVDA 2018) led to large draw-downs when perfection did not arrive.  
Course-correction: Demand fundamental proof BEFORE paying for it. A Sell/Under-weight keeps capital flexible and avoids anchoring bias.  

Past mistake: Ignoring relative opportunities.  
Course-correction: Maintain secular semi exposure via SOXX while releasing AMD-specific risk.

——————————————————————————  
Bottom Line  

Great roadmap, wrong price. The bear’s quantitative concerns outweigh the bull’s qualitative hopes, and even the neutral camp admits that “a P/E of 136 is a significant indicator of risk.” Capture existing gains, redeploy later on evidence or at a saner multiple.
