## News Analysis

### Current Economic Report: Week Ending September 22, 2025

This report provides a comprehensive overview of recent macroeconomic trends and significant developments impacting global markets, with a focus on the recent trajectory of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR).

#### Global Macroeconomic Developments

1. **China's Monetary Policy**:
   - On September 22, 2025, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), announced a shift towards a data-driven monetary policy aimed at supporting economic recovery. These measures are critical for ensuring liquidity and reducing funding costs, particularly as the Chinese economy shows signs of slowing down despite a resilient export performance. The absence of imminent major stimulus measures may be indicative of a cautious approach from PBOC amidst mixed economic signals.

2. **Australia's Economic Stability**:
   - Australian economic prospects remain relatively strong. RBA Governor Michele Bullock emphasized on September 22 that slowing inflation and a robust labor market would support economic growth. The RBA's decision to gradually cut interest rates to 3.6% reflects an optimistic outlook, although ongoing global uncertainties have raised concerns about potential impacts on domestic consumption recovery.

3. **Swiss National Bank Stance**:
   - A recent Reuters poll indicated that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is expected to keep its policy rate at 0.00% through 2026, attributed to stable inflation and a resilient Swiss currency. This environment helps maintain economic stability but limits the SNB's options to respond should inflationary pressures emerge.

4. **Geopolitical Tensions Affecting Oil**:
   - Oil prices have been influenced by heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. Brent crude increased to $67.07 per barrel while WTI reached $63.02, amid fears surrounding escalating conflicts and security concerns stemming from recent military actions displayed in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine. 

5. **U.S. Federal Reserve Outlook**:
   - Investor attention is shifting towards the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction following recent rate cuts. Markets expect further easing, projecting an additional 44 basis points of cuts by year-end, which has implications for currency strength and market sentiment. Complications arise from trade tensions and immigration policy changes affecting sectors like technology.

#### Recent Developments in Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)

1. **UK Military Partnership**:
   - Palantir's stock experienced volatility but recently surged significantly following reports of an impending agreement for a £1 billion ($1.5 billion) partnership with the UK military to enhance AI capabilities. These developments may significantly bolster Palantir's revenue streams and fortify its position within government contracts.

2. **Defying Valuation Concerns**:
   - Despite a momentary dip, PLTR has shown resilience with shares rebounding post-August lows. Analysts indicate that while the stock has experienced substantial growth (over 2000% in the past three years), elevated valuations could pose risks, especially as expectations build around its military contracts and AI advancements.

3. **Market Sentiment and Analyst Predictions**:
   - Analysts remain divided on Palantir's prospects, with some bearish on its potential for significant growth given high valuations—forecasting a potential pullback. The bullish sentiment stems from impressive contract acquisitions and overall market enthusiasm surrounding AI solutions. This divergence in opinion highlights the need for traders to consider both growth potential and valuation risks.
   
4. **Institutional Involvement**:
   - Reports indicate strong institutional interest in PLTR, with notable investments from multiple management firms, which is typically a bullish indicator for stock performance. However, the response from institutions is reflective of mixed confidence regarding long-term growth amidst concerns over current valuations.

2. **High Valuation Ratios**: The P/E ratio of 471.1 suggests that the market has high expectations for future earnings growth. This is typical for tech companies involved in innovative fields like artificial intelligence and data analytics.

### Conclusion
Palantir Technologies Inc. showcases strong financial health with robust revenue and profitability metrics, although its high valuation ratios suggest that the market has high growth expectations. Investors should weigh the potential risks associated with such valuations against the company's growth trajectory and market potential.

### Key Takeaways for Traders
- **Current Market Sentiment**: Analysts and traders remain optimistic about the future growth prospects of PLTR, but caution is warranted due to high valuation metrics.
- **Investment Strategy**: Potential investors may consider building positions on dips, while existing shareholders might monitor earnings releases closely to gauge whether growth expectations are being met.

### Final Transaction Proposal
Given the company's strong fundamental outlook but high valuation metrics, traders might prefer a cautious approach.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD** 

This position allows existing investors to benefit from potential upside while being wary of current market valuations that suggest the stock is priced for significant growth.

## Research Team Decision

Here’s how I see the debate, boiled down to the brass-tacks arguments that really matter.

Key Bull Points  
• Palantir’s topline is still growing solidly (mid-20s % YoY) and management just landed a headline-grabbing £1 billion UK defence deal.  
• Foundry/Gotham continue to be regarded as best-in-class data-fusion tools; switching costs are high for clients once installed.  
• Technical tape is bullish (50- & 200-day MAs rising, MACD positive). Bulls view any pullback as a buy-the-dip chance.  
• The AI/analytics TAM is exploding and investors routinely pay premium multiples for category leaders.

Key Bear Points  
• Valuation is eye-watering: P/E > 470 and price-to-sales > 17; even with optimistic growth, multiple compression is a real risk.  
• Heavy insider selling at these levels implies management thinks shares are rich.  
• Revenue mix is still government-heavy; budgets are hostage to politics and possible austerity.  
• Competition (Snowflake, Databricks, hyperscalers) is intensifying and often cheaper.  
• Macro clouds (rate cuts into slowdown, geopolitical risk) make expensive tech especially vulnerable to multiple resets.

My Decision: SELL / AVOID NEW MONEY

Why the bear case wins  
1. No margin of safety. At ~17× sales and ~470× GAAP earnings, the stock prices in flawless execution plus another leg of hyper-growth. Even if PLTR doubles earnings over the next two years, you’re still paying triple-digit P/E.  
2. Insider signaling. Founders and senior execs have been steady net sellers. That isn’t always damning, but at this valuation it’s a yellow flag you can’t ignore.  
3. Crowded trade. AI enthusiasm has pushed PLTR’s RSI close to overbought; any market wobble could trigger a violent de-rating, and history shows richly valued “story stocks” correct hard when sentiment cools.  
4. Better risk/reward elsewhere. You can get mid-20 % revenue growth and GAAP profitability from other software names at half—sometimes a third—of the multiple.

I’m not blind to Palantir’s strengths, but as fiduciaries we have to weigh upside versus downside. Today the risk-adjusted return skews negative.

Detailed Investment Plan

1. Position Action  
   • If you own PLTR: Exit the core position over the next 5–10 trading days. Use a staggered approach (e.g., sell 50 % at market immediately, then place GTC limit orders ~3 % above spot to take advantage of any last-gasp strength).  
   • If you do not own PLTR: Do not initiate. Put it on a watch-list with a buy-trigger only if the stock re-rates to < 10× forward sales or < 60× forward earnings (roughly the $10–12 area based on current estimates).

2. Optional Hedging (for those who cannot liquidate)  
   • Buy 3-to-6-month 15-delta put options; finance them by simultaneously writing out-of-the-money covered calls (e.g., sell the 25 strike, buy the 15 strike). This collars the position and limits damage if a valuation reset occurs.  

3. Re-entry Framework  
   • Revisit the name after the next two earnings prints. Key checkpoints: commercial revenue growth > 30 %, government mix < 50 %, sustained GAAP margins > 15 %.  
   • If those show up AND valuation compresses, we’ll consider switching to Buy.

4. Portfolio Re-allocation  
   • Rotate capital into high-quality software names trading < 10× forward sales with similar or better growth (e.g., ServiceNow, CrowdStrike) or into short-duration treasuries while we wait for better entry points in tech.

Learning from Past Mistakes  
I’ve previously held onto richly valued innovators too long, assuming “the story” would protect me. When multiples eventually cracked, gains evaporated fast (Zoom in 2021 taught me that). Today I’m applying that lesson: good company ≠ good stock if pricing is wrong. We protect capital first, hunt upside second.

Bottom line  
Great product, great narrative, wrong price. Lock in gains or stay on the sidelines until Palantir’s fundamentals catch up to its storytelling.

## Trading Team Plan

After thoroughly considering the provided investment plan for Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and analyzing both the bullish and bearish arguments, here’s my evaluation:

### Key Observations:
1. **Solid Growth vs. Valuation Concerns**: While PLTR shows impressive topline growth with a substantial government deal and high-quality product offerings, the valuations present a critical risk. A P/E ratio exceeding 470 and a price-to-sales ratio above 17 indicate that the stock is priced for perfection, leaving little room for error.

2. **Insider Selling**: The heavy insider selling raises red flags. This suggests that those closest to the company believe the shares are overvalued at current levels, making it prudent for external investors to reassess position sizes.

3. **Market Sentiment and Competition**: Current market conditions show the stock as near overbought, characterized by strong enthusiasm for AI, but this also results in increased vulnerability to any adverse market signals. Competing products from established players further complicate the narrative for PLTR.

4. **Historical Lessons**: Learning from past experiences with high-growth tech stocks, the caution against holding positions that are purely based on narrative resonated strongly. The history of significant revaluations in "story stocks" emphasizes the importance of valuing capital preservation over potential upside.

### Recommendation:
Given these insights, it is prudent to take action based on the high-risk evaluation of PLTR. **The combination of high valuation, insider selling, increased competition, and general market volatility suggests that maintaining or increasing exposure to PLTR is not advisable at this time.**

The detailed investment plan recommends exiting positions in a staggered manner if currently invested and advises against initiating new positions unless significant corrections occur.

Thus, my firm decision is to **sell** any holdings in PLTR and refrain from making new investments in the stock until a more favorable valuation presents itself.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**

## Portfolio Management Decision

Recommendation: SELL  

––––––––––––––––  
1.  Summary of the Debate’s Most Material Points  

Risky / Bull  
• “Palantir operates in the lucrative realm of data analytics, where demand is continuously soaring…high growth can justify high valuations.”  
• £1 billion UK-defence deal + best-in-class Foundry/Gotham raise the ceiling for future contracts.  
• Technical tape is bullish; momentum traders will “buy the dip.”  

Safe / Bear  
• “At ~470× GAAP earnings and >17× sales, even minor disappointments can trigger a drastic sell-off.”  
• Pattern of heavy insider selling is “a yellow flag you can’t ignore.”  
• Revenue mix is still government-heavy; budgets are hostage to politics and austerity.  
• Comparable growth software names trade at half the multiple, offering better risk/reward.  

Neutral  
• A monitored Hold could capture upside while “remaining watchful for signs of over-extension.”  
• Competition could both dilute share and spur innovation—outcome still uncertain.  

2.  Why the Bear Case Prevails  

Valuation vs. Growth Reality  
The bulls concede growth is “mid-20 % YoY.” Even if that pace holds for three years and margins expand, the stock would still be >60× earnings on 2026 numbers—hardly a bargain. The upside scenario therefore requires not just continued execution but accelerating growth plus sustained AI euphoria. That is a low-probability, high-dependency bet.

Insider Signalling  
Executives have been “steady net sellers.” When the people with the fullest information are cashing out into strength, risk managers listen. The argument that this is mere “portfolio balancing” rings hollow given the size and persistence of the sales.

Asymmetric Pay-off  
Downside: 30 – 50 % multiple compression is entirely plausible if macro, rates, or a single earnings miss bite—history is littered with richly priced software names that corrected violently (Zoom, Snowflake, Atlassian, etc.).  
Upside: to justify today’s price, Palantir must rapidly widen margins, outrun hyperscaler competition, and keep contract momentum flawless. The reward/risk skew is negative.

Technical vs. Fundamental  
Momentum indicators are positive, but RSI is near overbought and sentiment is crowded. A late-cycle breakout built on multiple expansion is fragile; when fundamentals and positioning diverge, fundamentals win eventually.

Neutral’s “Hold” Option Rejected  
Holding makes sense only if a) the stock is fairly valued or b) downside can be hedged cheaply relative to upside. Here puts are expensive (implied vol >40 %) and carrying the position ties up capital better deployed in cheaper growth names or T-Bills. “Wait and see” is not free; opportunity cost matters.

3.  Refined Trade Plan (builds on the trader’s draft)

If You Own PLTR  
• Exit 50 % immediately at market.  
• Place GTC limit orders 3 % above last sale for the remaining 50 %; cancel any unfilled lots after 10 trading days.  
• For positions that cannot be fully closed (tax, mandate, etc.), buy 3- to 6-month 15-delta puts and sell 25-delta calls in equal premium to collar exposure.

If You Do **Not** Own PLTR  
• Do not initiate. Place an alert to re-evaluate only if valuation compresses to <10× forward sales **and** we see two consecutive quarters of 30 %+ commercial revenue growth with GAAP EBIT margins >15 %.

Portfolio Re-deployment  
• Rotate proceeds into high-quality software names growing >25 % but trading <10× forward sales (e.g., CrowdStrike, Confluent) or park in 3-6-month T-Bills at 5 %+ while waiting for better entry points.  
• Keep 5 % of freed capital earmarked for opportunistic re-entry in case of an outsized draw-down (<$12).

4.  Lesson Applied from Past Mistakes  
Previous errors (Zoom 2021) stemmed from assuming “great company = great stock.” This time we separate story from price. Protecting capital when multiples disconnect from fundamentals preserves optionality to buy back later at rational levels.

Bottom Line  
Great product, great narrative—wrong price. Preserve capital now; revisit after either the fundamentals catch up or the valuation cools. The SELL decision best aligns with risk-adjusted returns and the duty to avoid asymmetric downside.
